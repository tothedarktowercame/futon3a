# Eight Gates (八門 Bā Mén)

Energy patterns for navigating tensions, drawn from Tai Chi's eight energies (八勁 bā jìn).

## Core Insight

**Patterns hold tensions, not obstacles.**

The preference model refinement (Mission 2) revealed that IF/HOWEVER fields are not obstacles to eliminate but tensions to navigate. The eight energies provide vocabulary for *how* to engage with these tensions.

Each energy is a mode of relating to incoming force—not fighting it, not collapsing under it, but transforming the relationship.

## Primary Energies (四正 Sì Zhèng)

| Energy | Hanzi | Mode | When to Use |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| [Péng](peng-ward-off.flexiarg) | 掤 | Ward off | Expand from rooted base to create space |
| [Lǚ](lu-roll-back.flexiarg) | 捋 | Roll back | Yield and redirect, adhering to force |
| [Jǐ](ji-press.flexiarg) | 擠 | Press | Concentrate force on specific point |
| [Àn](an-push.flexiarg) | 按 | Push | Whole-structure forward motion |

## Secondary Energies (四隅 Sì Yú)

| Energy | Hanzi | Mode | When to Use |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| [Cǎi](cai-pluck.flexiarg) | 採 | Pluck | Ground floating energy downward |
| [Liè](lie-split.flexiarg) | 挒 | Split | Separate coupled concerns |
| [Zhǒu](zhou-elbow.flexiarg) | 肘 | Elbow | Close-range action from center |
| [Kào](kao-lean.flexiarg) | 靠 | Lean | Structural presence, trunk energy |

## Mapping to Preference Model

| Preference Field | Energy Relationship |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Scope (IF)** | Determines which energies are appropriate—you can't apply the right response without reading the situation |
| **Risks (HOWEVER)** | Forces to redirect (Lǚ), not eliminate. Acknowledge by adhering, not by fighting |
| **Desired (THEN)** | The direction of structural push (Àn) when aligned |

## Mapping to Policies

| Policy | Primary Energy | Character |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Exploit | Àn (push) | Aligned forward motion |
| Explore | Lǚ (roll back) | Yielding, learning, redirecting |
| Balanced | Péng (ward off) | Resilient expansion from center |

## The Rooting Principle

All energies require rooting:

> "Péng is born from a good rooting of the feet on the ground."

In pattern terms: **verify scope conditions before engaging with risks or pursuing desired outcomes.** Without grounding, no energy mode works—you either collapse (ungrounded yield) or break (ungrounded resist).

## Implementation

The compass simulation (`src/futon/compass.clj`) uses eight-energy dynamics:

```clojure
(def energy-weights
  {:peng 0.30   ; ward off - default, expand from rooted base
   :lu   0.15   ; roll back - yield and acknowledge risks
   :ji   0.10   ; press - focus on single concept
   :an   0.10   ; push - aggressive forward motion
   :cai  0.10   ; pluck - ground by connecting risk to concept
   :lie  0.08   ; split - trade concept for risk awareness
   :zhou 0.10   ; elbow - small centered adjustment
   :kao  0.07}) ; lean - consolidate multiple risks
```

Each simulation step selects an energy (weighted toward Péng) and applies its characteristic mutation. The energy profile is tracked and reported.

## Future Work

- Add `@energy` field to existing patterns indicating primary engagement mode
- Explore sigil mapping: emoji = energy mode, hanzi = specific variant
- Investigate multi-energy sequences for complex pattern navigation
- Tune energy weights based on policy strategy (exploit → more Àn, explore → more Lǚ)
