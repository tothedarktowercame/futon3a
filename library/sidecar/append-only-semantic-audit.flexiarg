! conclusion: Keep semantic writes append-only with provenance at the store boundary.
  + context: Semantic evolution must be inspectable and reversible.
  + IF:
    Proposal or fact updates overwrite prior states.
  + HOWEVER:
    You need to revise or retire claims over time.
  + THEN:
    Persist every semantic write (proposal, promotion, evidence, action, fact, chain) as append-only
    records with identifiers and audit metadata, and reject duplicate ids at the store boundary.
  + BECAUSE:
    Append-only logs enable audits and provenance tracking without silent mutation.
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: docs/sidecar-promotions.md; docs/sidecar-promotion-flow.md; resources/sidecar/schema.sql
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: docs/sidecar-audit-flow.md; src/sidecar/store.clj
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: src/sidecar/store.clj; test/sidecar/store_test.clj
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Add explicit status transitions in the proposals table.
    - Append promotion and retirement events with timestamps.
    - Define a compact audit view for append-only events (per id).
