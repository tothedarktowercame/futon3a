! conclusion: Keep proposals and promotions append-only with provenance.
  + context: Semantic evolution must be inspectable and reversible.
  + IF:
    Proposal or fact updates overwrite prior states.
  + HOWEVER:
    You need to revise or retire claims over time.
  + THEN:
    Record status transitions as append-only events with decided_by and rationale.
  + BECAUSE:
    Append-only logs enable audits and provenance tracking.
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: docs/sidecar-promotions.md; resources/sidecar/schema.sql
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: docs/sidecar-audit-flow.md; resources/sidecar/schema.sql
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Add explicit status transitions in the proposals table.
    - Append promotion and retirement events with timestamps.
    - Provide a simple audit query for state history.
