! conclusion: Ground semantics on artifacts, entities, aliases, and mentions in SQLite.
  + context: Patterns and documents provide text that must be inspectable and queryable.
  + IF:
    Queries rely on embeddings alone without deterministic anchors.
  + HOWEVER:
    You still want fast similarity and fuzzy recall.
  + THEN:
    Store artifacts, entities, aliases, and mentions as deterministic extraction outputs.
  + BECAUSE:
    Grounding makes proposals auditable and promotes stable chain building.
  + evidence: docs/sidecar-grounding-and-chains.md
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define the artifacts, entities, aliases, and mentions tables.
    - Implement ingestion that hashes artifacts and records mention spans.
    - Add a minimal alias weighting scheme for lexical expansion.
