! conclusion: Use curated bridge triples to justify difficult hops.
  + context: Some chains need domain knowledge that embeddings cannot justify.
  + IF:
    A chain step requires a cross-domain leap with only fuzzy support.
  + HOWEVER:
    You still want puzzle-like chain recovery.
  + THEN:
    Store minimal bridge triples in SQLite and use them to justify or gate hops.
  + BECAUSE:
    Curated bridges provide explicit warrants without inflating facts prematurely.
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: docs/sidecar-promotions.md; resources/sidecar/schema.sql
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define the bridge_triples table and editing workflow.
    - Reference bridge triples in chain evidence output.
    - Use bridges to allow otherwise gated sense shifts.
