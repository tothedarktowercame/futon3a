! conclusion: Build short chains and report softness per hop.
  + context: Users need explainable chains, not just candidate lists.
  + IF:
    Queries return flat neighbor lists without justification.
  + HOWEVER:
    You want puzzle-like chain recovery with clear evidence.
  + THEN:
    Build short chains over arrows, bridges, and proposals, and report softness metrics.
  + BECAUSE:
    Softness accounting shows where fuzz enters the chain and enables review.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Implement chain scoring that prioritizes arrows over bridges over proposals.
    - Output per-hop evidence and softness counts.
    - Add penalties for ungated sense shifts.
