! conclusion: Promote proposals to facts only via explicit, logged actions.
  + context: Facts must remain authoritative and defeasible.
  + IF:
    Proposals become facts implicitly or through side effects.
  + HOWEVER:
    You want good proposals to become facts when warranted.
  + THEN:
    Require a promote action that validates constraints and appends a promotion record.
  + BECAUSE:
    Explicit promotion prevents silent contamination and preserves auditability.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define promotion log records with rationale and decided_by.
    - Add constraint checks before writing to XTDB.
    - Record facts as fact, warrant, and retired event types.
