! conclusion: Promote proposals to facts only via explicit, logged actions.
  + context: Facts must remain authoritative and defeasible.
  + IF:
    Proposals become facts implicitly or through side effects.
  + HOWEVER:
    You want good proposals to become facts when warranted.
  + THEN:
    Require a promote action that passes the validation gate and appends a promotion record.
  + BECAUSE:
    Explicit promotion prevents silent contamination and preserves auditability.
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: docs/sidecar-promotions.md; docs/sidecar-promotion-flow.md; resources/sidecar/schema.sql
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: docs/sidecar-audit-flow.md; docs/sidecar-promotion-flow.md; resources/sidecar/schema.sql
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define promotion log records with rationale and decided_by.
    - Route promotion writes through the validation gate (required fields, enum constraints, score bounds).
    - Reject direct fact writes outside the promotion action.
