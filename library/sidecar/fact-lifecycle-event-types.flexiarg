! conclusion: Model facts with explicit lifecycle event types (fact, warrant, retired).
  + context: Facts must be authoritative, defeasible, and auditable over time.
  + IF:
    Fact state changes are implicit or modeled as overwrites.
  + HOWEVER:
    You still need fast reads and clear current truth.
  + THEN:
    Record lifecycle events as append-only types (fact, warrant, retired) with rationale and actor metadata.
  + BECAUSE:
    Explicit lifecycle events preserve audit trails and clarify which facts are currently active.
  + evidence: docs/sidecar-promotion-flow.md; docs/sidecar-promotions.md
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define the event type enum and required fields.
    - Require lifecycle events for all promoted facts.
    - Add a view that resolves the active fact state from the event stream.
