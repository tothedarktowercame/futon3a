! conclusion: Treat query as a first-class operation via Drawbridge.
  + context: Intent lives in the database and queries must be expressive.
  + IF:
    Pattern retrieval is constrained to fixed endpoints.
  + HOWEVER:
    You need SPARQL-like flexibility without endpoint sprawl.
  + THEN:
    Use Drawbridge and portal helpers so queries can compose lex, ANN, and chain steps.
  + BECAUSE:
    First-class queries support rich exploration and align guidance with intent.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Add portal subcommands for suggest, propose, and promote.
    - Document how to query intent and pattern metadata directly.
    - Include examples that mix lexical and ANN expansion.
