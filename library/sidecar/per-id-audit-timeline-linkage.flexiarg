! conclusion: Resolve per-id timelines across linked semantic records.
  + context: Audits must show how a proposal becomes a promotion and fact, not just isolated records.
  + IF:
    Per-id queries only return exact id matches and ignore related records.
  + HOWEVER:
    Operators need a contiguous narrative for each claim.
  + THEN:
    Link timelines across relationships (proposal->promotion->fact, evidence targets, chain steps)
    and surface all related events in a single per-id view.
  + BECAUSE:
    Cross-entity linkage turns append-only logs into inspectable histories.
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: src/sidecar/store.clj; test/sidecar/store_test.clj
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Add explicit ordering rules when timestamps collide.
    - Provide a query that returns only the latest active fact state for an id.
