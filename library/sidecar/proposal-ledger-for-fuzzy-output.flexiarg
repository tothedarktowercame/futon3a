! conclusion: Record all fuzzy results as proposals with evidence in SQLite.
  + context: ANN search yields useful candidates without authority.
  + IF:
    Vector neighbors are used directly as facts or chain steps.
  + HOWEVER:
    You need fuzzy recall to propose candidates for review.
  + THEN:
    Write each fuzzy output as a proposal with score, method, and evidence.
  + BECAUSE:
    A proposal ledger preserves provenance and enables explicit promotion.
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: docs/sidecar-promotions.md; resources/sidecar/schema.sql
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: docs/sidecar-audit-flow.md; resources/sidecar/schema.sql
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Implement the proposals table and status workflow.
    - Store neighbor ids and distances in evidence_json.
    - Add CLI support for propose and review.
