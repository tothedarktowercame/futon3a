! conclusion: Separate facts, memes, and notions into distinct stores.
  + context: You need semantic gain without allowing fuzzy output to become authoritative.
  + IF:
    Similarity search and curated semantics share one store or one truth level.
  + HOWEVER:
    You still need fast candidate proposals and inspectable semantics.
  + THEN:
    Use XTDB for facts, SQLite for inspectable memes, and ANN/HNSW for notions, and enforce boundaries.
  + BECAUSE:
    Each store has a different trust level; separation keeps fuzz from becoming fact.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define the three adapters and enforce that ANN results only create proposals.
    - Add checks that facts are written only through explicit promotion.
    - Document store responsibilities and invariants.
