! conclusion: Represent semantic transforms as typed arrows with status and confidence.
  + context: Chain recovery depends on explicit, interpretable links.
  + IF:
    Chain steps are untyped or implied only by similarity.
  + HOWEVER:
    You need translation, abstraction, and metonymy moves.
  + THEN:
    Store arrows with mode, payload, scope, confidence, and status.
  + BECAUSE:
    Typed arrows make transforms inspectable and scoreable in chains.
  + evidence: docs/sidecar-grounding-and-chains.md
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define the arrows table and a required mode vocabulary.
    - Require status transitions (draft, active, retired).
    - Add validation for scope tags and confidence ranges.
